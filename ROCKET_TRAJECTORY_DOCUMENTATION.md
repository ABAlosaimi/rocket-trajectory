# Rocket Trajectory Prediction System: Comprehensive Documentation

## Overview and Introduction

The Rocket Trajectory Prediction System is an interactive visualization tool designed to help understand the complex interdependencies between various factors that affect rocket flight accuracy. This system models how different physical forces, environmental conditions, and rocket characteristics interact to determine the final trajectory and landing accuracy of a rocket.

Rocket trajectory prediction is a critical aspect of aerospace engineering, used in everything from space exploration missions to military applications and commercial satellite launches. Understanding these factors is essential for mission planning, safety assessments, and optimizing launch parameters.

## Core Mathematical Framework

### Primary Trajectory Impact Formula

The foundation of this prediction system is based on the following mathematical relationship:

**Formula:** `(WVi) / (Θ A G)`

This formula represents the **Trajectory Impact Factor**, which quantifies how various forces interact to affect rocket accuracy.

#### Variable Definitions:
- **W**: Wind speed (m/s) - The velocity of atmospheric air movement
- **Vi**: Initial velocity (m/s) - The rocket's velocity at launch
- **Θ (Theta)**: Launch angle (degrees) - The angle between the rocket's initial trajectory and the horizontal plane
- **A**: Air resistance coefficient - A dimensionless factor representing aerodynamic drag
- **G**: Gravitational acceleration (m/s²) - The downward acceleration due to Earth's gravity

#### Formula Interpretation:
This formula expresses the ratio of momentum-related forces (wind speed × initial velocity) to resistance forces (launch angle × air resistance × gravity). A higher value indicates greater potential for trajectory deviation, while lower values suggest more stable flight paths.

**When to Use:** This formula is most applicable for:
- Initial trajectory planning
- Quick impact assessments
- Comparative analysis between different launch scenarios
- Educational understanding of factor interactions

**Example Calculation:**
Given:
- Wind speed (W) = 10 m/s
- Initial velocity (Vi) = 100 m/s
- Launch angle (Θ) = 45°
- Air resistance (A) = 0.3
- Gravity (G) = 9.81 m/s²

Trajectory Impact Factor = (10 × 100) / (45 × 0.3 × 9.81) = 1000 / 132.435 = 7.55

This relatively high value indicates significant potential for trajectory deviation under these conditions.

## Primary Trajectory Factors

### 1. Initial Velocity (Vi)
**Definition:** The speed at which the rocket leaves the launch platform, measured in meters per second (m/s).

**Significance:** Initial velocity is the most critical factor in trajectory prediction, with a 95% impact level. It determines the rocket's kinetic energy and directly influences:
- Maximum altitude achieved
- Range of the trajectory
- Time of flight
- Susceptibility to environmental disturbances

**Physical Relationship:** Higher initial velocities generally lead to more stable trajectories because they reduce the relative impact of environmental factors. However, they also increase air resistance effects.

### 2. Launch Angle (Θ)
**Definition:** The angle between the rocket's initial flight path and the horizontal plane, measured in degrees.

**Significance:** With a 90% impact level, launch angle is the second most critical factor. It determines:
- The shape of the trajectory arc
- Maximum altitude vs. horizontal range trade-offs
- Optimal angle for specific target distances

**Physical Relationship:** The optimal launch angle depends on the target distance. For maximum range without air resistance, 45° is optimal. However, with air resistance, the optimal angle is typically between 30-40°.

### 3. Gravity (G)
**Definition:** The gravitational acceleration acting on the rocket, approximately 9.81 m/s² on Earth's surface.

**Significance:** Gravity has an 85% impact level and is the primary force causing the rocket to follow a curved trajectory rather than a straight line.

**Physical Relationship:** Gravity acts constantly downward, causing the rocket's vertical velocity to decrease during ascent and increase during descent. It's the fundamental force that creates the parabolic trajectory shape.

## Environmental Variables

### 1. Air Resistance (A)
**Definition:** A dimensionless coefficient representing the aerodynamic drag force acting on the rocket.

**Formula Component:** The air resistance coefficient (A) in our main formula represents the combined effect of these aerodynamic factors.

### 2. Wind Speed (W)
**Definition:** The velocity of atmospheric air movement relative to the ground, measured in m/s.

**Significance:** Wind speed has a 65% impact level and can cause significant trajectory deviations, especially during the initial phase of flight.

**Physical Relationship:** Wind affects the rocket through:
- Direct force application during flight
- Changes in effective air resistance
- Crosswind effects that can cause lateral drift

### 3. Air Density (ρ)
**Definition:** The mass of air per unit volume, typically measured in kg/m³.

**Significance:** Air density has a 55% impact level and directly affects air resistance magnitude.

**Physical Relationship:** Air density varies with:
- Altitude (decreases with height)
- Temperature (warmer air is less dense)
- Humidity (moist air is less dense than dry air)
- Atmospheric pressure

**Mathematical Relationship:** Air resistance force = 0.5 × ρ × v² × Cd × A
Where:
- ρ = air density
- v = velocity
- Cd = drag coefficient
- A = cross-sectional area

### 4. Temperature
**Definition:** The ambient air temperature, measured in Celsius or Kelvin.

**Significance:** Temperature has a 30% impact level, primarily affecting air density and thus air resistance.

**Physical Relationship:** Higher temperatures result in:
- Lower air density
- Reduced air resistance
- Changes in atmospheric pressure
- Potential effects on rocket engine performance

### 5. Humidity
**Definition:** The amount of water vapor in the air, typically expressed as relative humidity percentage.

**Significance:** Humidity has a 20% impact level, with relatively minor direct effects on trajectory.

**Physical Relationship:** Humidity affects:
- Air density (moist air is less dense)
- Atmospheric pressure
- Potential condensation effects on rocket surfaces

## Rocket Characteristics

### 1. Mass (m)
**Definition:** The total mass of the rocket, including fuel, payload, and structure, measured in kilograms.

**Newton's Second Law Application:** The rocket's acceleration is inversely proportional to its mass for a given force.

### 2. Shape/Drag Coefficient (Cd)
**Definition:** A dimensionless number representing the aerodynamic efficiency of the rocket's shape.

**Significance:** Shape and drag coefficient have a 60% impact level, directly affecting air resistance.

**Physical Relationship:** The drag coefficient depends on:
- Rocket nose shape (pointed vs. blunt)
- Body geometry (streamlined vs. irregular)
- Surface finish (smooth vs. rough)
- Reynolds number (velocity × size / viscosity)

**Typical Values:**
- Streamlined rocket: Cd ≈ 0.1-0.3
- Blunt-nosed rocket: Cd ≈ 0.4-0.8
- Irregular shape: Cd > 1.0

### 3. Spin Rate
**Definition:** The rotational velocity of the rocket around its longitudinal axis, measured in revolutions per minute (RPM).

**Significance:** Spin rate has a 40% impact level, providing gyroscopic stability but potentially affecting trajectory.

**Physical Relationship:** Spin affects:

## Prediction Accuracy Methods

### 1. Ballistic Trajectory
**Definition:** A simplified trajectory calculation assuming only gravity and initial velocity, ignoring air resistance and other forces.

**Formula:** For projectile motion without air resistance:
- Horizontal position: x(t) = v₀ₓ × t
- Vertical position: y(t) = v₀ᵧ × t - 0.5 × g × t²

Where:
- v₀ₓ = initial horizontal velocity = v₀ × cos(θ)
- v₀ᵧ = initial vertical velocity = v₀ × sin(θ)
- t = time
- g = gravitational acceleration

**When to Use:** Quick estimates, educational purposes, or when air resistance is negligible.

**Limitations:** Significantly underestimates trajectory complexity in real-world conditions.

### 2. Numerical Integration

**Process:**
1. Divide flight time into small time steps (Δt)
2. Calculate forces at each step
3. Update velocity and position using:
   - v(t+Δt) = v(t) + a(t) × Δt
   - s(t+Δt) = s(t) + v(t) × Δt + 0.5 × a(t) × Δt²
